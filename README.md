# deltarune-rng-patch
A patch for racing in Deltarune Speedrunning that adjusts key RNG to always favour the player.

As of now, this patch only fixes the Roulxs Fight in Chapter 2, and the Swatchling odds in Chapter 2. I will soon update it to include a mauswheel fix, and various Chapter 1 fixes. If you have other suggestions of things to fix, dm me on discord at "southerncanal".

**Installation**
Download the bps, then download Floating IPS at https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/, and run flips.exe. Then, choose "Apply Patch" and select the bps file you downloaded. Then it'll ask for a file to patch, navigate to the unmodified 1.15 data.win file from the demo version (MAKE SURE ITS BACKED UP), and select it. Save the new file as data.win inside the Deltarune folder, and then you should be set! If you have any trouble, dm me on discord at "southerncanal".
